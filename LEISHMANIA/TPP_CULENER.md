## Target Product Profile (TPP)

This Target Product Profile (TPP) outlines the acceptable and optimal requirements of the assay for evaluating the performance of the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in Nepal. Each criterion includes a clear rationale grounded in the project context.

## Test Performance

| **Item**                 | **Acceptable Requirement**                                            | **Optimal Requirement**                                                      | **Rationale** |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Diagnostic specificity   | Irrelevant                                                            | Irrelevant                                                                    | Focus is on RDT performance evaluation, not direct diagnosis. |
| Diagnostic sensitivity   | Irrelevant                                                            | Irrelevant                                                                    | Same as above. |
| Analytical specificity   | Detect only Leishmania, avoid cross-reaction with other pathogens     | Detect only Leishmania, no cross-reaction                                     | The test should outperform the RDT in specificity. |
| Analytical sensitivity   | Equivalent to 47 parasites                                            | Detect 1 Leishmania parasite equivalent                                       | The RDT detects 187 parasite equivalents; this assay should be 75% more sensitive. |
| Positive Predictive Value| Irrelevant                                                            | Irrelevant                                                                    | Depends on disease prevalence, which is unknown in this context. |
| Negative Predictive Value| Irrelevant                                                            | Irrelevant                                                                    | Same as above. |
| Resolution               | Differentiate *L. major*, *L. donovani* complex, *L. siamensis*, *L. tropica* | Differentiate 5 Leishmania spp. found or potentially circulating in Nepal | Literature reports only *L. major* and *L. donovani*, but regional circulation of others justifies broader resolution. |
