## 1. Analyzed Assay

This study aims to evaluate the methodologies outlined by **Bennis et al. (2018)** for the extraction of DNA from skin lesion biopsies of *Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL)* suspected cases. Additionally, **PCR and RFLP analysis** will be carried out to detect and identify *Leishmania spp.* targeting the internal transcribed spacer 1 (**ITS1**) of the ribosomal DNA.

## 2. Analysis

All assessments together must cover the entire **Target Product Profile (TPP)**.

> ⚠️ *Note: TPP criteria are interlinked. Ensure coherence across sections.*

### 2.1 Analytical Sensitivity

**Criterion**  
Assess the analytical sensitivity of the PCR assay using samples from **200 clinically suspected CL patients** in West Nepal between **June 2024 – May 2026**.

**Responsible Scientist:** Opeoluwa Shodipe

**Analysis**  
DNA was extracted from lysate samples using the **phenol-chloroform method**, and ITS1 PCR detected **0.2 parasite/reaction**, equivalent to **20–40 picograms/reaction** (Nasereddin et al., 2008).

*In silico* analysis using **LITSR and L5.8S primers** showed limited specificity to *Leishmania siamensis*. Primer-BLAST returned only one result with other *Leishmania spp.*, and BLAST of that FASTA sequence yielded only 33 hits. This suggests **limited sensitivity/specificity for L. siamensis**, likely due to **insufficient sequence data in GenBank**.

> 📌 *Bennis et al. (2018) did not provide analytical sensitivity data.*

**Conclusion**  
Despite high sensitivity reported using ITS1 PCR, RDT methods are not validated for this context. **Further assessment** is required.

### 2.2 Processing Time / Throughput

**Criterion**  
Assess processing time for each batch of samples sent every 3 months from **June 2024 to August 2026**.

**Responsible Scientist:** Opeoluwa Shodipe

**Analysis**  
- **ITS1 PCR + RFLP** require ~3 hours to analyze positive reaction products.  
- Full processing (DNA extraction, PCR, and RFLP) requires **2–2.5 days** (Schönian et al., 2003).  

**Conclusion**  
Processing **25 samples every 3 months** is feasible. Based on the **target population**, **available manpower**, and **resource constraints**, batches of 25 samples will comfortably meet the study timeline, with all samples processed by **August 2026**.

## 3. Scoring Table

Use the following scale:

- **A** – 100% certainty that the requirement is met. No validation needed.  
- **C** – Likely fits the TPP but needs validation.  
- **E** – Definitely does not meet the requirement.  

| **Criterion**              | **Acceptable Requirement** | **Optimal Requirement** |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Analytical Sensitivity     | C                          | D                        |
| Processing Time / Throughput | A                        | A                        |
