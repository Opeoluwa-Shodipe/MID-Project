### Test Performance

| **Item**                    | **Acceptable Requirement**                      | **Optimal Requirement**                             | **Rationale** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Diagnostic specificity     | 80%                                             | 100%                                                | Our PCR test ideally achieves 100% specificity. However, since sequencing follows amplification, we accept 80% to identify non-specific amplifications and reduce sequencing costs. |
| Diagnostic/clinical specificity | Irrelevant                                  | Irrelevant                                          | We're evaluating an RDT's performance, not using it for clinical diagnosis. |
| Diagnostic sensitivity     | Irrelevant                                      | Irrelevant                                          | Not relevant, as we are not diagnosing disease. |
| Analytical specificity     | 100%                                            | 100%                                                | Our confirmation test must match the 100% specificity of the RDT to ensure sensitivity isn’t underestimated. |
| Analytical sensitivity     | Equivalent to 47 parasite equivalents           | 1 parasite equivalent                               | We aim for 1 parasite equivalent detection. Acceptable sensitivity is 75% higher than RDT's minimum (187 parasites). |
| Positive Predictive Value  | Irrelevant                                      | Irrelevant                                          | PPV depends on disease prevalence, which is not the focus of this study. |
| Negative Predictive Value  | Irrelevant                                      | Irrelevant                                          | Same as above. |
| Resolution (species discrimination) | Differentiate L. major, L. donovani complex, L. siamensis, L. tropica | Differentiate all 5 Leishmania spp. possibly circulating in Nepal | Although only L. donovani and L. major are reported, other species circulate nearby, and we want broad detection capability. |

### Study Sample

| **Item**                   | **Requirement**                                 | **Rationale** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Target host population    | Patients suspected of CL and tested with the CL RDT in Nepal | To evaluate RDT performance in real diagnostic settings |
| Target pathogen population | L. donovani complex, L. major, L. infantum, L. siamensis | Broader species detection to account for regional transmission |
| Target vector population  | Irrelevant                                       | Study is focused on patients, not vectors |
| Spatial dimensions        | Entirety of Nepal                                | Samples from across Nepal should be accurately analyzed |
| Temporal dimensions       | 2-year study duration                            | Covers complete research cycle |

### Sample Characteristics

| **Item**           | **Acceptable Requirement**         | **Optimal Requirement**                 | **Rationale** |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Sample type        | Skin lesion biopsy in DNA/RNA shield | Same                                   | Standard method for detecting CL |
| Sample volume      | 50 µL                              | 16.6 µL (triplicate)                    | Enables triplicate testing but accounts for low parasite burden |

### Feasibility

| **Item**                | **Acceptable Requirement**                             | **Optimal Requirement**                                     | **Rationale** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Processing time         | 4-hour test within 7 days of sample reception          | Immediate processing; storage in -20°C allows flexibility     | Max 2 samples/day; freeze-stored samples can be tested later |
| Storage/shipping samples| -20°C storage in DNA/RNA shield, freezer box shipping  | -80°C cold chain for indefinite stability                     | -80°C is ideal but not always feasible from rural sites |
| Storage/shipping reagents| Stable for ≥3 months and shipping duration            | Stable for ≥2 years or entire study at room temp              | Samples stored up to 3 months between shipments |
| Reagent availability    | Reliable every 3 months                                | On-demand availability                                        | Quarterly supply aligns with shipment schedule |
