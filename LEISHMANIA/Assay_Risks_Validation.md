## 1. Analysis Flowchart

A step-by-step breakdown of the main actions from sample reception to results reporting:

- **DNA extraction** from skin lesion samples  
- **Detection of *Leishmania spp.* by conventional PCR** targeting the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the rDNA gene  
- **Identification of *Leishmania spp.* using RFLP** via digestion of the PCR product with the restriction enzyme HaeIII  
- **2% Agarose electrophoresis** for PCR amplicons  
- **2% MetaPhor™ Agarose electrophoresis** for restriction fragments  
- **Reporting** the number and proportions of *Leishmania spp.* positive samples to the project PI

### 1.1 Molecular Target(s)

- **Target:** Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) of the *Leishmania spp.* rDNA gene  

---

### 1.2 Analysis Methods

- **Method:** Conventional PCR using LITSR and L5.8S primers (Bennis et al., 2018)  
- **Followed by:** RFLP digestion with **HaeIII** restriction enzyme

## 2. TPP Checklist

### 2.1 Resolution

**To what extent does your assay meet the criterion?**  
- The assay meets approximately **80%** of the resolution requirement.  
- Literature supports ITS1-rDNA + RFLP for differentiating Old World *Leishmania* spp.  
- However, most studies are from regions outside Nepal.  
- Only *Schönian et al.* reported differentiation between *L. donovani* and *L. infantum*—and even that is limited.  
- No known PCR-RFLP assays for *L. siamensis*.

**Knowledge Gaps:**  
- Can ITS1 PCR-RFLP reliably detect *L. siamensis* in Nepal?  
- Can *L. donovani* and *L. infantum* be consistently differentiated in this context?

**Mitigation Plan:**  
1. Perform *in silico* PCR using available sequences for *L. siamensis*, *L. donovani*, and *L. infantum*.  
2. Conduct *in silico* HaeIII digestion of PCR products to assess fragment resolution capability.

### 2.2 Analytical Sensitivity

**To what extent does your assay meet the criterion?**  
- Current methodology meets approximately **40%** of the analytical sensitivity requirement.  
- Variability arises from:
  - Different sample types
  - Use of Qiagen kits
  - Geographical variation
  - Limited GenBank data on *L. siamensis*

**Knowledge Gaps:**  
- Effectiveness of Qiagen kits in Nepal-specific samples.  
- Sparse sequence data for *L. siamensis* restricts reliable sensitivity analysis.

**Mitigation Plan:**  
1. Conduct a **pilot study** with Qiagen kits to test extraction reliability in Nepal.  
2. **Optimize PCR conditions**: primer concentration, annealing temperature, amplification cycles.  
3. Use **RFLP** to enrich sensitivity data on *L. siamensis*.  
4. **Collaborate with other research groups** to expand sample size and sequence diversity.

## 3. Bias Analysis

Identify non-random errors across the assay process.

---

### 3.1 DNA Extraction Bias

- DNA quality and quantity affect PCR sensitivity.  
- Low parasite loads may cause **false negatives** if extraction is inefficient.  
- Contaminants or fragmented DNA can interfere with primer binding and amplification.

---

### 3.2 PCR Sensitivity for *L. siamensis*

- Literature supports sensitivity for 4 out of 5 target species.  
- Very **limited data** exists on PCR detection of *L. siamensis*.  
- Potential bias in **mixed infections** if *L. siamensis* is under-detected due to primer sensitivity differences.

---

### 3.3 Sequence (RFLP)-based Bias

- Using external research group samples may introduce **sampling bias**.  
- If these samples are not geographically representative, the findings may not generalize.  
- **Species diversity** or location-specific prevalence could skew results.
